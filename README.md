# Gamebuino Music Demo

This is a demo for the Music Generation functionality that I am adding to the library for the [Gamebuino][] console.
This code is currently available in a [local fork](https://github.com/erwinbonsma/Gamebuino-META.git).

You need a Gamebuino device to install it and hear the music.
